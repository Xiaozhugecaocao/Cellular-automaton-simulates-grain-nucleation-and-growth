# Cellular-automaton-simulates-grain-nucleation-and-growth

A simple two-dimensional cellular automaton simulation model was established to simulate the nucleation and growth process of grains. This model is a basic template that only considers the following input variables: mesh size, number of grains, iteration steps, grain nucleation probability, and grain growth probability. The model can be modified based on different nucleation and grain growth theories (such as introducing supercooling, temperature gradient, temperature field, etc.) to simulate the grain nucleation and growth process under different conditions.
